# Manish Industries Website

Welcome to the Manish Industries Website project! This repository contains both the client-side and server-side applications for the Manish Industries website.

## Project Overview

The Manish Industries Website is designed to provide users with an engaging and informative experience about our products and services. The project is structured into two main parts:

- **Client**: The front-end application built using modern JavaScript frameworks. It handles user interactions and displays content dynamically.
- **Server**: The back-end application that manages data, handles API requests, and serves the client application.

## Features

- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.
- RESTful API for seamless communication between the client and server.
- Modular architecture for easy maintenance and scalability.
